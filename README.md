# hello-world
This is my first repository on Github. Hope to enjoy the journey.
I'm primarily a person open for learning and change. I respect ideas and I'm born to be create quite a few.
I have a love for artforms that come all types and sizes. Fun fact about myself, I consider coding as an artform too.
